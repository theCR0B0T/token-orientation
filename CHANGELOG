Change Log for Token Movement 8-bit Style.

1.0.2:

    -Added a mechanic that recognizes the key words UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT (or lowercase) in your file name.
    And automatically sets up the correct image in the correct slot when initializing the 8-bit movement
    when clicking the [+] icon in the token hud or token configuration window.
    Do make sure you have all four images in the same location.

    -Changed to 0.8.9 compatability.


1.0.3:
    -Added support for 8 directions if there you have the images for it. 
    Note: for now if you want those images to be Added directly on initializing, 
    they will need the suffixes UL, UR, DL, DR for Up Left, Up Right, Down Left and Down Right respectively
    Example: MyImage_UP.webp, MyImage_DOWN.webp, MyImage_LEFT.webp, MyImage_RIGHT.webp, 
             MyImage_UL.webp, MyImage_UR.webp, MyImage_DL.webp, MyImage_DR.webp.
    These would get placed on init immediately.

    -If you dont have the images / dont want to use diagonals keep the setting OFF in the configuration.

    -Now supports NUMPAD keys for movement too.

1.0.4:
    -Fixed a small issue with auto-application of the images to the correct direction if certain suffixes 
    are present in the file names. Now should accept lowercase and uppercase.
    -added a wiki (very bare bones for now): https://gitlab.com/Freeze020/8bit-movement/-/wikis/Home

1.0.5:
    -Fixed errors when canvas is disabled.

1.0.6:
    -In v9 configuration can be done again in the Token Configuration dialog.

1.0.7:
    -Added support for v10.

1.0.8:
    -quick bug fix, a check for movement was wrong in v10 version.

1.0.9:
    -another fix for img => texture.src


1.1.0:
    -overhaul for the way token textures are updated for v10+ only. Should result in better performance now only one update is used. Also no longer dependent on key presses will. Mouse dragged position changes also result in token texture direction change.
    -would have done this for v9 too were it not that it somehow overrides the movement animation resulting in teleporting tokens. So alas for v9 users no changes for you!

1.2.0:
    -added support for Foundry v12
    -added warning if no directional images were set
    -added setting to disable warnings

1.2.1:
    -fixed diagonal movement not working in v12

1.2.2:
    -now requires libWrapper for v12
    -added setting to disable animation on rotation
